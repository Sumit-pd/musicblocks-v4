# Beginner's Guide to Contributing to Musicblocks-v4


## Introduction

Musicblocks-v4 is a _Visual Programming Language_ and collection of
_manipulative tools_ for exploring musical and mathematical concepts
in an integrative and fun way.



## System Overview:

#### Tech Stack:
- **Client-side Web Application**:
    - **Written in TypeScript**: *TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing. TypeScript offers all of JavaScript’s features, and an additional layer on top of these: TypeScript’s type system.*
    - **UI Components with React**: *React is used to render the user interface components.React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces*
    - **Flexibility in UI Libraries/Frameworks**: *The project is designed to work independently with any JavaScript UI library/framework or even the JS DOM API directly.*
- **Bundling and Tooling**:

    - **Vite**: *Vite is utilized as the bundler for the project. It helps with fast development by leveraging native ES module imports.*
    - **SCSS**: *SCSS (Sass) is used for styling, providing a more structured approach to writing CSS.*

#### Development Environment:

  - **Node.js**: *The project requires Node.js as the runtime environment to execute JavaScript on the server side.*


#### Tooling:
- **ESLint**: *ESLint is a tool for code linting, ensuring code quality and consistency in adherence to defined coding standards.*
 - **Docker**:* Docker is used for containerization, creating a consistent and isolated environment for development and deployment.*

#### Testing and Quality Assurance:
 - **Jest**: *Jest is employed for JavaScript testing, covering unit tests for code.*
 - **Cypress**: *Cypress facilitates end-to-end testing, simulating user behavior to ensure application functionality.*

#### Contributing and Development Process:

- **GitHub Project Management**:

    - The project leverages GitHub for task management via its Projects tab.
    - Discussions tab is used for planning and tracking progress.

- **Parallel Development Repository**:

    - Development of the programming framework occurs in the musicblocks-v4-lib repository.
    - The 'develop' branch and related feature branches serve as sources for updates.
    - Issues tab in both repositories is used to track tasks and issues.

## Tips for Effective Contributions:
- **Understand the Project**:
    - Explore Documentation: Familiarize yourself with project documentation, including README files, contributing guidelines, and coding standards.

    -  Review Existing Code: Study the existing codebase, understanding its structure and architecture. This helps in aligning your contributions with the project's overall design. 
- **Follow Contribution Guidelines**:
    - Adhere to Coding Standards: Ensure your code meets formatting, naming conventions, and project-specific best practices.
   - Contribute Purposefully: Focus on existing issues or feature requests aligned with the project roadmap.
-  **Write Clean and Readable Code**:
    - Modular and Maintainable: Break down your code into logical and reusable components to enhance readability and maintainability.
    - Use Descriptive Naming: Use meaningful and descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes to convey their purpose.
- **Test Your Contributions**:
    - Test Your Code: Write tests to validate your changes and ensure they don't introduce new bugs. Ensure both unit and integration tests are covered if applicable.
    - Check for Edge Cases: Consider edge cases and handle them appropriately in your contributions.
